# Data Dashboard Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Data Dashboard Project. This repository hosts a web-based dashboard that allows for static data visualization. Our initial release focuses on providing users with a set of predefined data visualizations and tables to explore.

## Initial Features

- **Static Data Visualizations:** A collection of charts and graphs that display predefined datasets.
- **Data Tables:** Interactive tables that users can sort and filter to better understand the data presented.
- **Predefined Dashboard:** A curated set of visualizations that give insights into the dataset provided.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To view and interact with the dashboard, ensure you have the following:
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)

### Installation

This initial version does not require any installation or server setup. Simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start exploring the dashboard.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Warnex04/Dashboard-Website.git
```
## Work in Progress (WIP) Features

The following features are currently under development and will be part of future releases:

- **Dynamic Dashboard Creation**: Users will be able to upload their own CSV files and generate charts based on their data.
- **Customizable Dashboard Layout**: Users will be able to drag and drop visualizations to design their own dashboard layout.
- **Responsive Visualizations**: Ensuring that all charts and graphs are fully responsive and look great on any screen size.
- **Data Upload and Parsing**: Implementation of a robust CSV parser to handle various data formats and layouts.

Stay tuned for updates as we work on bringing these features to life!
